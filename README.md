## Fresh Strapi

Open source Fresh Example Project using Redis and Strapi.

A [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) project at https://fresh-strapi.deno.dev

Install Redis on your Strapi server, or get Redis Cloud.

## Marionette

Thats what I called my testing setup.

A [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) project at https://marionette.deno.dev

This is intereting because it has Puppeteer Testing integrated with Github
Actions!

Try:

```
deno test -A
```

But you need to install chrome with this first:

```
PUPPETEER_PRODUCT=chrome deno run -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/puppeteer@14.1.1/install.ts
```

(mac & linux, run `deno test -A` on windows and hopefully it will give you the
right link)

## Github Actions

Runs `deno fmt` and the Puppeteer tests on Github Actions using a Linux Host.
Fork the project and push to main or test to try it out.

.github/workflows/deno.yml

### Things to do

Setup the tests so they launch the project, and test that version.

## Fresh Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
